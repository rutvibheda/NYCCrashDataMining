# NYCCrashDataMining

This project deals with data mining. Given a huge datset,  with the  accidents that 
had taken place in different boroughs, after selecting one borough we found out the 
details of the accidents as to how they took place, at what time and such other important details.
The algorithm used was KMeans clustering for its efficiency to identify accident hotspots and 
Plotly was used to generate heat maps and other important visualizations.
